# HonestCyberEval

HonestCyberEval assesses AI models’ capabilities and risks in automated software exploitation, focusing on their ability
to detect and exploit vulnerabilities in real-world software systems.
It models an end-to-end cyber real task and requires from the model to provide structured inputs to trigger known
sanitizers (i.e., proof of exploitation).
We currently leverage the Nginx web server repository augmented with synthetic vulnerabilities (AIxCC) and we are
expanding the projects and number of synthetic vulnerabilities we use for our assessment.

## Setup

- Install dependencies:

  ```shell
  sudo apt install make
  ```

- [Install `yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
  - E.g.:

    ```shell
    sudo snap install yq
    ```

- To avoid issues with address randomisation ([more info](https://github.com/aixcc-public/challenge-004-nginx-cp/blob/bd4490502e9e8f42b45e536cbc05d78ebc41aa0e/README.md?plain=1#L53)), run:

  ```shell
  sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28
  echo "vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
  ```

- Set up the environment variables and API keys:
  - Rename the `.env.example` file:

  ```shell
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  - Generate a new personal access token (PAT) (<https://github.com/settings/tokens>) with `read:packages` permissions.
    Fill in the `GITHUB_USER` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` values.
  - Fill in API keys for the LLM(s) that are to be evaluated (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `AZURE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### Docker

The evaluation challenge projects are run inside Docker containers.
If Docker is unavailable, installing it by following the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).
Then, enable [managing Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

To be able to pull Docker images for the challenge projects, log into `ghcr.io` using your PAT, run:

  ```shell
  echo "<token>" | docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin
  ```

replacing `<user>` and `<token>` with your generated PAT.

## Running the evaluation

First, configure which challenge project should be downloaded by (un)commenting the appropriate entries in
[`config/cp_config.yaml`](./config/cp_config.yaml).

Run the `make cps` command to download the code and docker images associated with challenge projects defined in
`cp_config.yaml`. The code will be downloaded to [cp_root](cp_root).

Finally, run the evaluation using `inspect eval exploit.py --model=<model> -T cp=<challenge project> -S max_iterations=<num>` e.g.

For example:

```shell
inspect eval exploit.py --model=openai/o1 -T cp=nginx-cp
```

will run the `nginx-cp` project with the default 5 reflexion loops and 3 epochs.
A successful attempt will terminate the current loop and skip future epochs.

The optional `critique_model` solver parameter allows a different model to be called for the critique component of the solver:

```shell
inspect eval exploit.py --model=openai/o1-mini --solver=reflexion_vuln_detect -S critique_model=openai/o1
```

The first run will be slower as it will patch and build multiple copied of the project.
We recommend starting a mock run first to create the test projects before running the eval, but it is not required:

```shell
inspect eval exploit.py --model=mockllm/model -T cp=nginx-cp -S max_iterations=1
```

## Future work

- Use Inspect Docker sandbox instead of AIxCC Docker scripts for better integration
- Support challenge projects that expect input as bytes
- More tasks
